# Weather Application Project Plan

**Project Overview:**

Our project aims to create a user-friendly weather application that allows users to input a location and receive accurate weather information. The application will utilize various APIs and coding techniques, including JavaScript, HTML, CSS for the frontend, and Flask and Python for the backend.

**Project Team:**

- Product Owner & Scrum Master: [Team Member Name]
- Frontend Developers: [Team Member Names]
- Backend Developers: [Team Member Names]

**Project Timeline:**

- **Phase 1: Planning and Setup**
  - Define project scope and requirements (1 day)
  - Set up frontend repository and backend Flask portfolio (2 days)
  - Research and choose appropriate weather APIs (2 days)

- **Phase 2: Frontend Development**
  - Create basic UI layout for weather application (3 days)
  - Implement user input functionality for location (2 days)
  - Integrate API calls for weather data retrieval (4 days)
  - Design user-friendly display for weather information (3 days)

- **Phase 3: Backend Development**
  - Set up Flask routes for handling API requests (3 days)
  - Implement data processing and formatting for frontend consumption (5 days)
  - Establish data caching mechanisms for improved performance (3 days)

- **Phase 4: Integration and Testing**
  - Combine frontend and backend components for seamless functionality (3 days)
  - Conduct extensive testing for data accuracy and application stability (4 days)

- **Phase 5: Refinement and Deployment**
  - Gather user feedback and make necessary UI/UX improvements (4 days)
  - Optimize codebase for scalability and performance (3 days)
  - Deploy the application on a cloud platform for public access (2 days)

**Project Repository Structure:**

- **Frontend Repository:**
  - HTML files for UI structure
  - JavaScript files for user interactivity
  - CSS files for styling and design

- **Backend Repository:**
  - Python files for Flask implementation
  - API handling scripts for data retrieval
  - Data processing modules for frontend consumption

**Project Deliverables:**

- Fully functional weather application with a user-friendly interface
- Documentation detailing the application's features, APIs used, and deployment instructions
- Presentation slides highlighting the development process and challenges faced

**Risk Management:**

- Potential API limitations or restrictions
- Unexpected delays in frontend-backend integration
- User experience discrepancies across different browsers and devices

**Communication Plan:**

- Regular team meetings twice a week for progress updates and issue resolutions
- Instant messaging platform for quick communication and issue discussions
- Email updates for any major decisions or changes in the project scope

**Conclusion:**

By following this project plan, we aim to develop a reliable and user-friendly weather application that meets the requirements of our Computer Science Principles class. Our team is dedicated to delivering a high-quality product within the specified timeline and ensuring a smooth user experience for our application.
